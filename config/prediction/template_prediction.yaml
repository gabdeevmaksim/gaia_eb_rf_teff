# Copy this file and customize for your use case

model:
  # Trained model file (wildcards supported)
  # Examples:
  #   - Exact: "rf_my_model_20251212_123456.pkl"
  #   - Wildcard: "rf_my_model_*.pkl" (uses most recent)

  # Optional: Filter data before prediction
  # Examples:
  #   - Only objects without Teff: {teff_gaia: -999.0}
  #   - Temperature range: {teff_gaia: [5000, 7000]}
  #   - Multiple filters: {teff_gaia: -999.0, logg_gaia: -999.0}
